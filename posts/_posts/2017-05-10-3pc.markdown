title: Three-phase commit protocol - 3PC

Three-phase commit protocol (**3PC**) is a distributed algorithm that lets
all nodes in a **distributed** system agree to commit a transaction. Unlike
the two-phase commit protocol (2PC), however, 3PC is **non-blocking**.

Specifically, 3PC places an upper bound on the required time
before a transaction either commits or aborts. This property ensures
that if a given transaction attempts to commit via 3PC and holds
resource locks, it will release the locks after the timeout.

The three-phase commit protocol consists of the following steps:

1. The coordinator sends a request to all participants to prepare to commit the transaction.
2. Each participant prepares to commit the transaction by performing any necessary actions, such as acquiring locks or reserving resources.
3. Each participant sends a response to the coordinator indicating whether it is ready to commit the transaction.
4. If all participants are ready to commit the transaction, the coordinator sends a commit request to all participants.
5. Each participant commits the transaction by making the necessary changes to its database or other resources.
6. Each participant sends a confirmation to the coordinator that the transaction has been committed.
7. The coordinator sends a final confirmation to all participants that the transaction has been committed.

If any participant is not ready to commit the transaction, the coordinator sends a rollback request to all participants, and the transaction is rolled back.

The three-phase commit protocol adds an additional phase to the two-phase commit protocol in which the coordinator receives
confirmation from all participants that the transaction has been committed. This allows the coordinator to ensure that
the transaction has been successfully committed even if one or more participants fail or become unavailable.

However, it also adds additional overhead and complexity to the process, as it requires more communication between
the coordinator and the participants.
