Three-phase commit protocol (3PC) is a distributed algorithm which lets
all nodes in a distributed system agree to commit a transaction. Unlike
the two-phase commit protocol (2PC) however, 3PC is non-blocking.
Specifically, 3PC places an upper bound on the amount of time required
before a transaction either commits or aborts. This property ensures
that if a given transaction is attempting to commit via 3PC and holds
resource locks, it will release the locks after the timeout.
