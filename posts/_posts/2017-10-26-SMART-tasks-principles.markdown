[SMART](http://xp123.com/xplor/xp0308/index.shtml) model is used for creating effective goals.

* S - Specific
* M - Measurable
* A - Achievable
* R - Relevant
* T - Time-boxed

#### Specific
Specific enough that everyone can understand what is involved in it.

#### Measurable

Indicators of progress. The team needs to agree on what that mean.
Basically describe your vision of "Definition of Done".


#### Achievable

Stories are broken into tasks for the developers, but a customer should still
be able to expect that every task can be explained and reasonable.

#### Relevant

A good story can be estimated. We don't need an exact estimate,
but just enough to help the customer rank and schedule the story's implementation.

#### Time-boxed

A task should be limited to a specific duration. This does not mean that
task must be estimated in hours or days, but should be an expectation of time frames.
