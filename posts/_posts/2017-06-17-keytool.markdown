Java Keytool is a key and certificate management utility. It allows users
to manage their own public/private key pairs and certificates. It also
allows users to cache certificates. Java Keytool stores the keys and
certificates in what is called a keystore. By default the Java keystore
is implemented as a file. It protects private keys with a password. A Keytool
keystore contains the private key and any certificates necessary to complete
a chain of trust and establish the trustworthiness of the primary certificate.


Each certificate in a Java keystore is associated with a unique alias. When
creating a Java keystore you will first create the .jks file that will initially
only contain the private key. You will then generate a CSR and have a
certificate generated from it. Then you will import the certificate to the
keystore including any root certificates. Java Keytool also several other
functions that allow you to view the details of a certificate or list the
certificates contained in a keystore or export a certificate.

Keytool location:

```bash
$JAVA_HOME/jre/bin/keytool
```

Default password for keystore in keytool:

```bash
changeit
```

View keystore information:

```bash
keytool -list -v -keystore privateKey.store
```

View Java certificates:

```bash
$JAVA_HOME/jre/bin/keytool -list -v -keystore $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts
```


Install certificate:

```bash
keytool -importcert -file certificate.cer -keystore keystore.jks -alias "Alias"
```

Install certificate to java keystore:

```bash
$JAVA_HOME/jre/bin/keytool -importcert -file certificate.cer -keystore $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts
```
