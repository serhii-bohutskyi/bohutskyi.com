Quality attributes tactics are strategies and techniques that are used to improve the quality of a software system. 
Quality attributes refer to the characteristics or features of a system that are important to its users or stakeholders,
such as performance, reliability, security, and usability.

There are several common quality attributes tactics that are used to improve the quality of a system, including:

1. Performance optimization: Performance optimization tactics are used to improve the speed and efficiency of a system.
This can include techniques such as optimizing code, reducing the number of database queries, and using caching and 
other performance-enhancing technologies.

2. Reliability improvement: Reliability improvement tactics are used to ensure that a system is able to function correctly and 
consistently over time. This can include techniques such as implementing robust error handling and monitoring,
 and using redundant components to improve fault tolerance.

3. Security enhancement: Security enhancement tactics are used to improve the security of a system and protect it 
 from external threats. This can include techniques such as implementing secure coding practices, using secure 
 communication protocols, and performing regular security audits.

4. Usability improvement: Usability improvement tactics are used to make a system easier and more intuitive for users. 
his can include techniques such as conducting usability testing, simplifying navigation and user flows, and using 
clear and concise language in user interfaces.
