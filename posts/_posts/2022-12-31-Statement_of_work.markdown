A statement of work (**SOW**) in software development is a document that outlines the **scope**, **deliverables**, and **requirements** 
of a software development **project**. It typically includes details such as the project **goals** and **objectives**, 
the expected deliverables, the **timeline** for the project, the **roles** and **responsibilities** of the various parties involved, 
and the **resources** and **budget** required to complete the project.

The **SOW** is an important tool for defining the terms and conditions of a software development project, and it serves
as a reference point throughout the project to **ensure** that all parties are aligned on the project **goals** and **expectations**. 
The **SOW** is typically created at the beginning of the project, and it may be updated as the project progresses to reflect any changes in scope or requirements.

The **SOW** is an essential component of the software development process and can help to ensure that the project is completed 
successfully and on time. It is important to carefully review and agree upon the SOW before starting a software development
project to ensure that all parties have a clear understanding of the project requirements and expectations.
