A risk register is a tool that is used to document and track risks in a project or business. In the context of software development, a risk register table might include the following information:

| Risk                            | Probability | Impact | Mitigation                                                                 | Owner           | Status |
| ------------------------------- | ----------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------ |
| Unforeseen technical challenges | High        | High   | Perform thorough technical analysis before starting development            | Lead developer  | Open   |
| Lack of clear requirements      | Medium      | Medium | Gather detailed requirements from stakeholders before starting development | Product manager | Open   |
| Insufficient testing            | Low         | High   | Allocate more resources to testing                                         | QA manager      | Open   |
| Missed deadlines                | Low         | Medium | Use agile methodologies and regular progress meetings to stay on track     | Project manager | Open   |

In this example, the risk register table includes six columns:

1. Risk: A description of the risk. 
2. Probability: The likelihood that the risk will occur. 
3. Impact: The potential impact of the risk on the project or business. 
4. Mitigation: The actions that will be taken to mitigate the risk. 
5. Owner: The person or team responsible for managing the risk. 
6. Status: The current status of the risk (e.g., open, closed, mitigated). 

This risk register table can be used to help project managers or business leaders identify and prioritize risks in a software development project, and to take action to minimize the impact of those risks. It can also be used to track the progress of risk mitigation efforts and to ensure that risks are being properly managed.
