# Automatic failover

Automatic failover is the process of automatically moving an application
to a standby server during a failure or service event to save its uptime.
Automatic failover is an option means a zero downtime environment.

Today, automatic failover is choosed because little downtime tolerance is needed,
and there will be some complexity, cost, and risk that goes with that choice.
