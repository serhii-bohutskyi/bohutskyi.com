title: Automatic failover
description: failover,recovery,zero downtime

Automatic failover is a technique used to ensure the availability and reliability of a system or
application by automatically switching to a backup or standby system or component in the event of a failure or error.

There are several ways in which automatic failover can be implemented in a software development project:

#### Redundancy

Use redundant systems or components that can take over if the primary system or component fails.

#### Load balancing

Use load balancing techniques to distribute workloads across multiple systems or components,
so that if one system or component fails, the workload can be transferred to another system or component.

#### Monitoring

Use monitoring tools or processes to detect failures or errors and trigger the failover process.

#### Testing

Test the failover process regularly to ensure that it is working correctly and that the backup systems or components are ready to take over if needed.

Automatic failover is an important consideration in software development projects where availability and reliability are critical.
It can help to prevent downtime and ensure that the system or application continues to function even if there are failures or errors.
