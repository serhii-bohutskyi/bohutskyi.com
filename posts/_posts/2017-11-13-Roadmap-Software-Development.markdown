## Roadmap Software Development

A product roadmap shows the why and what behind what you’re building.
A roadmap is a high-level visual summary that maps out the vision and
direction of your product offering over time.

The roadmap has several ultimate goals:

* Describe the vision and strategy
* Provide a guiding document for executing the strategy
* Get internal stakeholders in alignment
* Facilitate discussion of options and scenario planning
* Help communicate to external stakeholders, including customers

The roadmap should focus, therefore, on high-level strategic concepts
— such driving growth, new market penetration, customer satisfaction, or market position.
