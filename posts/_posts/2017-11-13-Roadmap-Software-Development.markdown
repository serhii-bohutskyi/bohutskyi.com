A **roadmap** in software development is a high-level plan that outlines the goals, priorities, and key milestones for a project.
It is a way to visualize the overall direction of the project and to communicate that direction to stakeholders, 
such as team members, customers, and management.

A roadmap may include a variety of elements, such as:

### Goals and objectives
The high-level goals and objectives of the project, such as increasing revenue, improving customer satisfaction, or launching a new product.

### Priorities
The key priorities of the project, such as new features, performance improvements, or bug fixes.

### Milestones
Key events or achievements that mark progress towards the goals and objectives of the project, such as the completion 
of a new feature or the launch of a new product.

### Dependencies
Any dependencies or constraints that may impact the project, such as external factors or the need to coordinate with other teams or projects.

### Timeline
A timeline that shows the planned sequence of events or milestones and the estimated completion dates for each.

A roadmap is a living document that should be regularly reviewed and updated as the project progresses. 
It is an important tool for managing and communicating the direction of the project and for aligning the efforts of the 
team with the goals and objectives of the project.
