A stakeholder is a person or group that has an interest or concern in something, especially a business. A stakeholders
matrix is a tool that is used to identify and analyze the interests and concerns of stakeholders in a project or
business. It is typically used to help project managers or business leaders understand the needs and expectations of
stakeholders and to ensure that their concerns are addressed in the planning and execution of a project or business.

Depending on viewpoint:

| Contact                           | Role               | Domain                          | Viewpoint                                |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| John Doe<br/>john_doe@gmail.com   | Solution Architect | Business Domain or applications | context, component-connector, deployment |
| Jihna Doe<br/>jihna_doe@gmail.com | Delivery Manager   | Business Domain                 | roadmap, estimations, team line-up       |
| Jack Doe<br/>jack_doe@gmail.com   | CTO                | Business Domain                 | solution, estimations, team line-up      |

Another sample of the table:

| Stakeholder       | Influence | Interest | Involvement | Impact |
| ----------------- | --------- | -------- | ----------- | ------ |
| Customer          | High      | High     | High        | High   |
| Employee          | Medium    | High     | High        | Medium |
| Investor          | High      | High     | Low         | High   |
| Regulatory agency | High      | Medium   | Medium      | High   |
| Supplier          | Medium    | Medium   | Medium      | Medium |
| Community         | Medium    | Low      | Low         | Low    |

In this example, the stakeholders matrix table includes six stakeholders and five columns:

1. Stakeholder: The name of the stakeholder group.
2. Influence: The stakeholder's ability to influence the project or business.
3. Interest: The stakeholder's level of interest in the project or business.
4. Involvement: The stakeholder's level of involvement in the project or business.
5. Impact: The impact that the stakeholder's involvement or non-involvement could have on the project or business.
   
This table could be used to help project managers or business leaders understand the needs and expectations of each stakeholder group and to ensure that their concerns are addressed in the planning and execution of a project or business.
