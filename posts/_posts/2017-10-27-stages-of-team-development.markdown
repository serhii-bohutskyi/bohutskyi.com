## About Model

In 1965, psychologist Bruce Tuckman said that team goes through
5 stage of development, which are forming, storming, norming, performing
and adjourning. All stages are critical to pass for building high-performance team.

## Forming

The team has just been introduced and everyone is overly polite and positive.
As leader, you play a dominant role at this stage, because team members' roles and responsibilities are not clear.

## Storming

Storming is a next phase after forming. This stage most difficult as for me.
Storming often starts with conflicts, because team members have different
experience and working styles. People understand their roles and responsibilities,
they can be uncomfortable with the new approach or workload.

## Norming

When people starts resolve their differences, starts norming phase.
They may socialize together. One another can ask for help and provide
constructive feedback. On this stage progress will be better as before.
People starts give strong commitment.

## Performing

Performing stage reaches when team and process normalized.
As a leader, you can delegate much of your work, and you can concentrate on developing team members.

## Adjourning or mourning

Many teams will reach this stage eventually.
Once a project ends, the team disbands. This phase is sometimes known as mourning
because members have grown close and feel a loss now that the experience is over.
