2PC is a distributed algorithm that coordinates all the processes that
participate in a distributed atomic transaction to ensure that either all
the resources are updated or none of them.

Two phase commit protocol is an atomic commitment protocol for distributed
systems. This protocol as its name implies consists of two phases.
The first one is commit-request phase in which transaction manager coordinates
all of the transaction resources to commit or abort. In the commit-phase,
transaction manager decides to finalize operation by committing or
aborting according to the votes of the each transaction resource.

2PC protocol guarantees global atomicity, its biggest drawback is that
it is a blocking protocol. Whenever the coordinator fails, cohort sites
will have to wait for its recovery. This is undesirable as these sites
may be holding locks on the resources. In the event of message loss,
the two-phase protocol will result in the sending of more messages.
