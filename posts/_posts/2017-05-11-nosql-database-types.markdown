There are 4 basic types of NoSQL databases:

* Key-Value Store â€“ Every single item in the database is stored as an
attribute name (or 'key'), together with its value. (Riak, DynamoDB)

* Document-based Store - It stores documents made up of tagged elements.
Documents can contain many different key-value pairs, or key-array pairs,
or even nested documents.(MongoDB, CouchDB)

* Column-based Store - Each storage block contains data from only one
column (HBase, Cassandra)

* Graph-based - Used to store information about networks of data, such as
social connections. (Neo4J, Giraph)
