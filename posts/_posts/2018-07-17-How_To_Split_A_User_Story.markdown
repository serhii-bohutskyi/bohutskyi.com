title: How to split a user story

A user story is a description of a feature or functionality from the perspective of an end user. It is typically used
in agile software development as a way to describe the desired outcome of a piece of work.

There are several ways to split a user story into smaller, more manageable pieces of work. Some common techniques include:

1. **Splitting by functionality**: This involves breaking the user story down into smaller stories that each cover
   a specific piece of functionality.

   For example, if the original user story was
   _"As a user, I want to be able to search for products on the website,"_
   it could be split into smaller stories such as
   _"As a user, I want to be able to search by keyword"_
   and
   _"As a user, I want to be able to filter search results by category."_
2. **Splitting by scope**: This involves breaking the user story down into smaller stories that cover a smaller scope of functionality.

   For example, if the original user story was
   _"As a user, I want to be able to search for products on the website"_
   it could be split into smaller stories such as
   _"As a user, I want to be able to search for products by keyword on the homepage"_
   and
   _"As a user, I want to be able to search for products by keyword on the search results page."_
3. **Splitting by user role**: This involves breaking the user story down into smaller stories that focus on the needs
   and expectations of different user roles.

   For example, if the original user story was
   _"As a user, I want to be able to search for products on the website"_
   it could be split into smaller stories such as
   _"As a casual shopper, I want to be able to search for products by keyword"_
   and
   _"As a power user, I want to be able to save and reuse complex search queries."_
4. **Splitting by technical complexity**: This involves breaking the user story down into smaller stories based on the technical
   complexity of the work involved.

   For example, if the original user story was
   _"As a user, I want to be able to search for products on the website"_
   it could be split into smaller stories such as
   _"As a user, I want to be able to search for products by keyword" (which might be relatively simple to implement)_
   and
   _"As a user, I want to be able to search for products using advanced search criteria such as price range and product
   attributes" (which might be more complex to implement)_

It is important to note that the specific approach to splitting a user story will depend on the specific needs and context of the project.
The goal is to break the story down into smaller, more manageable pieces of work that can be delivered incrementally.
