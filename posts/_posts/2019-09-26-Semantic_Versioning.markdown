**Semantic versioning** is a system for versioning software releases that uses a combination of numbers and labels to indicate
the **level** of changes in a new **release**. It is designed to help users understand the potential **impact** of upgrading to
a new version of a software product.

According to semantic versioning, version numbers have the following **format**:

**MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**

* **MAJOR**: This number is incremented when there are **incompatible** API changes.
* **MINOR**: This number is incremented when new, **backwards-compatible** functionality is added.
* **PATCH**: This number is incremented when **small**, **backwards-compatible** bug fixes are made.

In addition to the above numbers, semantic versioning also allows for the use of labels such as "alpha" or "beta"
to indicate the stability of a release. For example, a version number of **2.0.0-beta** would indicate that the release is
a beta version of the **2.0.0** release.
