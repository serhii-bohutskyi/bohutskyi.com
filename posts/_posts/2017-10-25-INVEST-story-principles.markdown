Good user stories follow Bill Wakeâ€™s [INVEST](http://xp123.com/xplor/xp0308/index.shtml) model.
They are Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, and Testable.

 *  I - Independent
 *  N - Negotiable
 *  V - Valuable
 *  E - Estimable
 *  S - Small
 *  T - Testable

### Independent
Stories should be independent, would be good if they are not overlapping.

### Negotiable
A good story captures the essence, not the details.

### Valuable

A story should be valuable to the customer, not for anybody.
If think of a product like a cake, we want to give the customer the essence of the whole cake,
and the best way is to slice vertically through the layers.

### Estimable

A good story can be estimated. We don't need an exact estimate,
but just enough to help the customer rank and schedule the story's implementation.

### Small

Smaller stories tend to get more accurate estimates.

### Testable

"Testability" has always been a characteristic of good requirements.
Actually writing the tests early helps us know whether this goal is met.

The **INVEST** criteria are often used to help teams **prioritize** user stories and ensure that they are **well-formed** and ready
for development. By evaluating user stories against these criteria, teams can ensure that they are **working** on the most 
valuable and achievable **pieces** of work and can **deliver** value to the end user in a **timely** and efficient manner.
