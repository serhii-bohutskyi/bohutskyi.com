Load balancers distribute traffic among multiple backend servers.
If one of those servers goes down, a load balancer will redirect traffic
to the others, assuring that your services continue to be available.

A load balancer also allows you to add additional resources to handle a
temporary traffic spike or a more consistent increase in demand.
Load balancing aims to optimize resource use, maximize throughput,
minimize response time, and avoid overload of any single resource.

## Load Balancing Algorithms

#### Round-robin
This algorithm distributes incoming requests evenly across a set of servers or resources in a rotating fashion. 
Each server or resource receives a request in turn, until all servers or resources have been used, at which point the process starts over.

#### Least connections
This algorithm assigns incoming requests to the server or resource with the fewest active connections.
It is often used to prevent overloading of servers or resources and to ensure that all servers or resources are used efficiently.

#### Weighted round-robin
This algorithm is similar to the round-robin algorithm, but it allows servers or resources to be assigned different weights or priorities. 
Higher-weighted servers or resources receive a greater proportion of incoming requests.

#### Least response time
This algorithm assigns incoming requests to the server or resource with the lowest average response time. It is often 
used to prioritize the allocation of requests to faster or more efficient servers or resources.

#### IP hash 
This algorithm assigns incoming requests to servers or resources based on the hash value of the client's IP address. 
It is often used to ensure that requests from the same client are consistently routed to the same server or resource.

The specific load balancing algorithm that is used will depend on the specific needs and requirements of the system. 
It is important to choose an algorithm that is appropriate for the workload and that meets the performance, reliability,
and scalability goals of the system.
