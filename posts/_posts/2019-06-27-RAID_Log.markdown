RAID analysis is a project planning technique for identifying key project 
Risks (R), Assumptions (A), Issues (I), and Dependencies (D). 
Project teams should complete an initial analysis at the beginning 
of the project and then monitor the issues via a RAID Log.

The RAID log focuses on four key areas:

* Risks – events that can have an adverse impact if they occur.
* Assumptions – things you assume are in place which contribute to the success of the project.
* Issues – current matters that need to be considered and addressed by the group.
* Dependencies – other projects or triggers that your project depends on, or are a beneficiary of your project outcomes.
