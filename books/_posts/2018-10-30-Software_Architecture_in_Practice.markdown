The authors have structured this edition around the concept of architecture influence cycles.
Each cycle shows how architecture influences, and is influenced by, a particular context in which architecture plays a critical role.
Contexts include technical environment, the life cycle of a project,
an organization’s business profile, and the architect’s professional practices.
The authors also have greatly expanded their treatment of quality attributes,
which remain central to their architecture philosophy—with an entire chapter devoted
to each attribute—and broadened their treatment of architectural patterns.
